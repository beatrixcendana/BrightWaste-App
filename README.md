## Description of the project
In the current situation with waste, we need to figure out how to recycle the waste we currently have, for example, glass bottle or even furniture.

It could be easier to sell it for a lower price directly, but instead of doing so, why don't we turn it into something more meaningful and can have more value to it? It doesn't only impact the earth; also, we can contribute to the economy cycle. 

Thatâ€™s why we provide <strong> EcoValue, which helps people to get plenty of ideas how to recycle their stuff and we help them to sell it for better price. </strong>

## Target and Location
- Students in Lacey, WA state, US (20-28 years old) who want to earn some money to pay for their tuition
- Old people (50+ years old) who has crafted mind

## Inspiration behind the project
Beatrix loves to do DIY in her own time. So, she thought of driving her car to a materials store close to her area to buy some wood to build a new shelf. Luckily, not only getting his wood to make the shelf, but Beatrix also got a chance to interview a worker in the shop and two other people that are around in the same shop.

The questions to all of them were the same: 
"Tell me how you reuse the materials that you have used before". 

Of course, before the interview started, Beatrix introduced herself. She explained why she interviewed them - The reason was that she was interested in learning more about how people's behavior impacts how they use/reuse their stuff). And it was shocking to listen to their answers:

## Research
To support the argument from above, we tried to do secondary research. Based on the research from homedepot.com:

- People prefer to buy the new material rather than use the reclaimed materials or used materials. It can tell from the number of customers bought the new one vs the used one.
