## Description of the project
Starting a business is a sort of hassle for most business owners. Even though the pandemic ends (not entirely), it doesn’t mean all businesses or restaurants can boost their marketing to increase sales. They have to struggle with advertising and social media marketing. Sometimes, those things don’t give so much exposure to the customers to visit their places, especially when the person has just started their business. The factors could be:
<strong> 
- The website doesn’t provide enough credibility to customers
- The business owners don’t know how to promote their business due to a lack of marketing skill </strong>

That’s why we provide EzyBusiness, which helps business owners to develop their website for free and the URL that specifically has all of the marketing thing related to the business.

## Target and Location
- Small business owners in Lacey, WA state, US
- Customers age 40-55 in Lacey, WA state, US

## Inspiration behind the project
It started with Beatrix visiting two businesses in Lacey, WA state, US. They both sell different types of things:

They mentioned that they had a hard time marketing their business, and in the end, they had to use paid ads to boost marketing and, at the same time, pay the other costs, such as the inventory, promo cost, food ingredients, workers, etc.
To support the argument from those two businesses, we tried to do secondary research. Based on the research,

We can tell that website is the first page where customers want to see what this business is about and what services they offer. Sometimes, all information on the internet about the business can overwhelm customers.

## Explanation of problem it solves
In this case, we focuses first on the business like restaurants and cafe. The problems we are trying to solve with our app/website:
### For business owners:
- Having a tech savvy issue while creating and maintaining their own website
- Hiring designers to custom their website might be quite expensive
- Managing social media is quite difficult especially to increase the traffic or click rate

### For customers:
- Having a hard time to find all information related to business in one page
- Having trust issue due to the website design (inconsistent design)
- Getting overwhelmed with many recommended options out there 
- Having a hard time to find the promo related to specific restaurant
- Getting many email spams when subscribing to the specific coupon website
